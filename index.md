##

I am a linguist at the [Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Ideas](http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/personer/vit/mariuslj/) at the University of Oslo researching the syntax of Latin. Most of my work is based on using computers and formal models of language, and applying them to historical languages. I received my PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/histlingcluster/members.html) in 2013. In a parallel life I am [a programmer](https://github.com/mlj).

## Areas of interest

* Lexical-functional grammar
* Latin syntax
* Syntax and semantics of control and binding
* Formal theories of syntactic change
* Treebanks and NLP techniques for historical languages

## Long-term projects

* [The PROIEL Treebank](http://proiel.github.io/)
* [The Cambridge Online Survey of World Englishes](http://www.tekstlab.uio.no/cambridge_survey/)
