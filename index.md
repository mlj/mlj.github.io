## Hello!

I am a postdoctoral fellow in classical languages at the [Department of
Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and
Ideas](http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/personer/vit/mariuslj/) at the University of
Oslo in the
[SynSem](http://www.hf.uio.no/english/research/theme/syntax-and-semantics/)
group.

I research the syntax of Latin or in other words the grammatical structure of
Latin sentences. Most of my work is based on using computers and formal models
of language. I received my PhD in Linguistics from the [University of
Cambridge](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/histlingcluster/members.html) in 2013. In
a parallel life I am [a programmer](https://github.com/mlj).

## Areas of interest

* Lexical-functional grammar
* Latin syntax
* Syntax and semantics of control and binding
* Formal theories of syntactic change
* Treebanks and NLP techniques for historical languages
