I am a linguist whose main field of research is the syntax of Latin. Most of my work is based on using computers and formal models of language, and applying them to historical languages. I received my PhD in Linguistics from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/histlingcluster/members.html#marius) in 2013, and I am one of the main contributors to the [PROIEL Treebank](https://proiel.github.io/) project at the University of Oslo. In a parallel life I am [a programmer](https://github.com/mlj).

## Areas of interest

* Lexical-functional grammar
* Latin syntax
* Syntax and semantics of control and binding
* Formal theories of syntactic change
* Treebanks and NLP techniques for historical languages

## Long-term projects

* [The PROIEL Treebank](http://proiel.github.io/)
* [The Cambridge Online Survey of World Englishes](http://www.tekstlab.uio.no/cambridge_survey/)
