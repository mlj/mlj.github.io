I am a linguist and software engineer. I have done research on the syntax of Indo-European languages, in particular Latin, using formal and computational methods.

## Areas of interest

* Lexical-functional grammar
* Latin syntax
* Syntax and semantics of control and binding
* Formal theories of syntactic change
* Treebanks and NLP techniques for historical languages

## Long-term projects

* [Syntacticus](https://syntacticus.org): a treebank of early Indo-European languages, in collaboration with [Dag Haug](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/people/aca/classics/tenured/daghaug/), [Hanne Eckhoff](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/our-academics/fellows/dr-hanne-eckhoff) and many others.
* [The Cambridge Online Survey of World Englishes](http://www.tekstlab.uio.no/cambridge_survey/), in collaboration with [Bert Vaux](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/bv230).
